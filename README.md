# InventoryService
 A microservice used to manage items and stocks


#### In a nutshell
In a nutshell, I become frustrated by the amount of parts im ordering for my projects, 
to combat the issue, I decided that I want to index every item and order that I make so that if Il need 
some parts in the future I can just look up and see if I have them in stock or that I need to order new ones.

###How does it work?
The microservice has three main endpoints and objects
/types
/objects 
/boxes
